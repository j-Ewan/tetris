# tetris
A tetris clone in python

One of my first big projects, so not the best
It got me into the tetris community though

dependencies: pip install pygame


default_settings.txt and dev_settings.txt are both presets, don't edit those
settings.txt is the one that actually matters



what's missing?
180 kick table
any sort of menu
proper tspin detection (although i like this one)
combo bonus
instant arr or softdrop
probably more too
