# tetris
A tetris clone in python

One of my first big projects, so not the best
It got me into the tetris community though

dependencies: pip install pygame


what's missing?
180 kick table
any sort of menu
proper tspin detection (although i like this one)
combo bonus
instant arr or softdrop
probably more too
